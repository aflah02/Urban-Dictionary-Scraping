# Urban Dictionary Scraper

A scraper which scrapes every single word from Urban Dictionary. (Currently running once done will add the dataset to kaggle and share the link here)

Todos:
- Speed Up using Multi Threading
- Reduce redundancy while scraping (couldn't find a way yet to avoid search hit overlaps)
- Can hit Connection Error due to prolonged requests (Workaround added with retry mechanism + sleep)
